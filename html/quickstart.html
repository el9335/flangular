<h2>Flangular Server Install and Run</h2>
<p>This tutorial assumes that your system has <tt>pip</tt> and <tt>easy_install</tt> installed, as they are required to install Flangular dependencies.  This version requires that the server be run on the same machine as the web application.</p>
<p>1. Clone the Flangular repository at <tt>https://github.com/el9335/flangular.git</tt>.</p>
<p>2. Enter the Flangular directory using <tt>cd flangular</tt></p>
<p>3. Build the app using <tt>sudo python setup.py install</tt>, or run as administrator on Windows (Windows is NOT natively supported by this application beyond calling the hosting system's separator for file paths.)</p>
<p>4. Start the server using <tt>sudo python flangular.py</tt>.  You should see the following output (or similar):</p>

<p>The second image shows a configuration from requesting tokenization of the contents of the text area where the results should be saved to the local file system.  Notice that server returns a path to the file containing the results of the request.  The contents of this file are <tt>["I", "wo", "n't", "pay", "the", "rent", "!", "You", "must", "pay", "the", "rent", "!"]</tt>.</p>
