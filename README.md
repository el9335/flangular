# flangular

Flangular NLP is a web application that enables a user to access a number of natural language processing tools via a RESTful API. 

Assumes that the host has pip and easy_install, which are used to install Flangular dependencies.

Note: 
The pyStatParser directory is not my work. It is used to perform dependency parsing on sentences.  Please learn more at their github page: https://github.com/emilmont/pyStatParser
